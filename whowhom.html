<p>These two words can be so confusing to even the seasoned writer. I mean really? How many of us use the word 'whom' in our daily lives?
A lot of writers, including myself, think that ‘whom’ is a bit persnickety. Perhaps if we imagined ourselves living in Tudor England about the time of famous playwright Bill Shakespeare, 'whom' might seem more like a normal part of our everyday vocabulary.</p>
<p class="grammarSentence">To whom shall I send this letter today?</p>
<p class="italics">"Ah yes, VorEnglish.com. I doth hear that they help many who seeketh help in grammar.”</p>
<p>'Who' and 'whom' can be quite tricky, but let’s break it down and find out how we can use these words appropriately.</p>
<p class="bold">Who vs. Whom: Just when do we use them?</p>
<p>How do we differentiate between the two words?</p>
<p>Who: Who is used as the subject of a verb or complement of a linking verb. It is a nominative (relating) pronoun.</p>
<p class="italics">Example:</p>
<p class="grammarSentence">It was I who wrote the paper on Monday.</p>
<p>Can you find the verbs? No scrolling down now…&#9786;</p>
<p>Here’s a hint: a verb is an action or a state of being. What is happening?
Did you find them? Great! Now, find the subjects for each verb.</p>
<p>Hint: What is the sentence talking about? Who or what is the focus?</p>
<p>Answers: The verbs are “was” and “wrote.”</p>
<p class="grammarSentence">It was I who wrote the paper on Monday.</p>
<p>The subjects are “I” and “who.”</p>
<p class="grammarSentence">It was I who wrote the paper on Monday.</p>
<p>Whom: Whom is used as the object of the verb or the object of a preposition. Hence why it is an objective pronoun.</p>
<p class="italics">Example:</p>
<p class="grammarSentence">You asked whom to the dance tonight?</p>
<p>The subject is 'you' and the verb is 'asked.' The pronoun 'whom' is following the verb and is the object of the verb; therefore, 'whom' is a correct choice for this sentence.</p>
<p>Be careful though. Make sure the prepositional pronoun in question isn’t also a subject. If it is, then you ought to use 'who.'</p>
<p class="italics">Example:</p>
<p class="grammarSentence">I cheered for who played hardest.</p>
<p>While the pronoun follows a preposition (for), it’s also the subject of the second verb (played). When placed as a subject, always use 'who.'</p>
<p>In conclusion, remember these tips when in doubt:</p>
<p>&#49;. When trying to decide whether who or whom is correct, simplify the sentence. It helps to move the words around in your head to identify the word relationships.</p>
<p class="italics">For example:</p>
<p class="boxed">“Princess Peach and her ladies-in-waiting only invited people to their party [who or whom] they considered to love parties as much as they did.”
The simplified mental version becomes <span class="italics">whom they considered</span>. ('whom' is correct)</p>
<p>&#50;. The distinction between 'who' and 'whom' is less important in informal spoken language than it is in formal written language, or language that is used academically and professionally.</p>
<p>Informal language, on the other hand, is more casual and often contains slang and other common vernacular.</p>
<p>Remember Fellow Writers: There is much confusion and misuse on this topic. Just as correctly using 'whom' may make others think that you are super-smart, misusing it may make you seem a bit silly. Never use 'whom' as a subject pronoun. This is as incorrect as using 'who' where 'whom' is required. Many people will mistakenly believe that you are trying to be formal.</p>
<p>“Whom are you?” is wrong. It is meant to be “Who are you?”</p>
<p>Happy Writing,</p>
