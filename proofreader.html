        <p>Developing your proofreading skills is essential to successful writing. Let’s face it: Finding someone who has the time or interest to revise your papers can be a challenge. You may have a friend or relative who either majored in English or specialized
            in writing and will be eager to help you, but most do not have such connections.</p>
        <p>However — help or no help — you are the most important editor of the final copy of your work, whether that be a paper for a class, cover letter, book, or even an email. Proofreaders are not born; they develop the skill and the key is to be strategic
            about it. Follow the list below, in order, and soon it will become habit. You might even become so proficient that you return the favor by proofreading a friend or colleague’s paper.</p>

        </figure>
        <p>&#49;.&nbsp;Start with a general overview of your work. Read for flow. Are your ideas presented logically? If not, you may consider changing the structure of  your paper, moving paragraphs and sentences, eliminating redundancies, or adding new
            sentences and transitional phrases (e.g. “although,” “however,” “similarly”) to create better flow.</p>
        <p>&#50;.&nbsp;Correct grammar, spelling, and punctuation. You may have come across these errors during step one and it is fine to correct them at that stage.  However, when your focus is solely on grammar, spelling, or punctuation, it is likely
            you will find additional errors you missed.</p>
        <p>&#51;.&nbsp;Minor changes. You are looking for minutiae: Checking numerical values, tab spacing, spacing between sentences, layout of charts and figures, and citations and references.</p>
        <p>After you have followed these 3 steps, set your work aside for a day and review it again using the 3 steps. This requires that you do not write your paper the night or morning before it is due. Few can write a first and final draft free of errors,
            so be sure to give yourself time to review your work.</p>

        <p>Some find that reading their work aloud helps. You can also print your draft and mark it up old school: breaking out the ol’ pens, pencils, and paper with the proverbial red ink if you like. The most effective method is to use what works for you.
            Writing is challenging and I am not innocent to the all-nighter, but take my wisdom and give yourself time to write and review your writing AT LEAST once before submission. And remember, your written word is a reflection of you, so make sure
            it shines.</p>
