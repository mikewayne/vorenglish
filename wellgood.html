            “How you doin’?” “Good.” Arghhhhh! This greeting and response happens dozens (or even thousands) of times a day, so much so that most people barely notice that it’s grammatically incorrect. But we do notice when the proper response is given -- “How you
            doin’?” “Well.” Our estimation of the person is enhanced. You show yourself as someone of quality. The question of when to use the word “good” or the word “well” is easy to answer: a thing or a place or a person is “good” whereas anything
            that takes place over time or is an action being performed uses the word “well.” Therefore, “How are you?” is best answered, “Good.” “How are you doing?” is best answered, “Well.” Similarly, “How are you feeling?” is best answered, “Good,”
            but “How have you been feeling?” is best answered, “Well.” How one is feeling is concrete and fixed therefore it’s a “good” feeling, but over time and subject to change needs to be described as “feeling well.” The grammatical distinction is
            that “good” is used when an adjective is appropriate and “well” when the word is being used as an adverb. If you’re familiar with the proper use of adverbs and adjectives, the question of which word to use becomes easy. But, it’s also easy
            even if you aren’t comfortable with distinguishing adverbs from adjectives. What do you think of this article so far? Is it good? I think it’s going well, don’t you? It would not be good to over-react and use well when it’s wrong to do so.
            For example, if asked “How’s work?’ the answer is “good,” (not “well”) Or, you can say it’s “going well.” Anything that is, that exists, that is fixed in time and place can be called “good” and anything that happens should be described as
            “going well,” “done well,” well-made,” and so on. Try some examples yourself: 1) A book. 2) An idea. 3) A trip. 4) A pass from one player to another. When do you describe them using the word “good” or the word “well?” 1) It was a good book,
            well-written. 2) It was a good idea, well-thought-out. 3) It was a good trip, planned well. 4) It was a good pass, well-played. Meanwhile, I telephone my son and ask how he’s doing. He answers, “well,” and I wait a moment, wondering if he
            means, “I’m doing well,” or “Well,” pausing before finishing his answer, “Well, I was about to have breakfast.” Oh, well. It will take discipline to change the habit of answering “good” when you’re asked how you’re doing. A good test is whether
            you’re describing something that “is” good or something that’s an action, process, or subject to change over time. And once you get accustomed to the proper usage of “well” and “good,” you won’t say at the end of the day, “I done good.” You’ll
            say, “I’ve done well.” And that’s a good thing.
