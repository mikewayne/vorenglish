            Do I feel bad or do I feel badly? When expressing remorse do you say, “I feel bad that you have to work today,” or “I feel badly that you have to work today?” Few disputes about grammar are as stark or vicious as the argument over which form is correct.
            There’s a pitched battle. Staunch grammarians will insist that since “feel” is a verb, it requires an adverb such as “badly” not an adjective such as “bad.” But, is that true? When you say, “I feel badly about how my hair looks today” is that
            the same as the choice between the adverb “well” and the adjective “good,” such as “It’s going well,” or “It’s going good?” In that case, the adverb “well” is clearly correct and the adjective “good” is clearly wrong. Some grammar experts
            contend that the same rule for using adverbs applies here and that we feel “badly” (the adverb) not “bad” (the adjective). That’s when the other school of grammarians swoops in with the taunting rhetorical question, “Is your sense of touch
            impaired?” They say that to “feel badly” means not to be able to use that sense well: “Are your fingers numb?” “Is it that you can’t feel?” The first school responds that no one – not a single listener – will ever hear the sentence “I feel
            badly that you have to work today” and think that the speaker’s ability to feel is impaired. It’s obvious that this statement has nothing to do with the sense of touch. If the rules of grammar are intended to create clear communication, then
            the correct form of a word should be judged by how accurately a thought is expressed; therefore, “I feel badly” is correct. So, which is it? How do you avoid a grammar mistake when some experts criticize one choice and other experts lampoon
            the other choice? We can find the answer by looking at “sense verbs.” What are sense verbs? The simple definition is that they are the verbs that refer to our five senses: “see, taste, feel, hear, and smell.” Each of these verbs contain two
            meanings: the acuity of that sense and the perception derived from that sense. In other words, the two meanings are the ability to use that sense and the specific outcome from the use of that sense. For example, “You smell good,” is a way
            to describe how you are experiencing that person while “You smell well,” describes how much ability you have to use the sense of smell. In the same way, “You smell bad,” (sorry about that) is different from “You smell badly.” You can try the
            other sense verbs, “see, taste and hear” with adjectives and adverbs and the choice seems clear. For example, things taste “sweet” (the adjective) not “sweetly” (the adverb) and they taste “bad” (the adjective) not “badly” (the adverb). Does
            this settle the question? Is the adjective always correct with sense verbs? If we apply this rule to “I feel,” it implies that “I feel bad” is correct. And it is. Never allow anyone to correct you if you use “bad.” Not only is it correct whenever
            it modifies a “sense” verb, but it’s also describing a state of being, in other words something that “is” rather than something that’s happening. The action of tasting, feeling, or using any sense has brought you a result: you feel bad. At
            the same time, it isn’t strictly wrong to say that you feel “badly.” It does say what you mean to say and therefore may not be scrupulously correct but remains acceptable. One of the joys of grammar is that there are times when you get a choice.
            This is true here. However, always make the choice an informed one. The preferred form with a sense verb is the adjective “bad.” You can never go wrong when you use the preferred choice, but if you make an informed choice for the less preferred
            form, “badly,” that is also acceptable. In conclusion, if you want a clear answer to settle this grammatical battle once and for all, don’t feel bad but do say, “I feel bad.” Sense verbs use adjectives to describe an outcome and so you feel
            “bad” that I have to work today. And thanks for the sympathy.</p>
