            Much or Many? (As Adjectives) Trying to figure out when to use “much” or when to use “many” when speaking or writing is not as difficult as you’d think. As a matter of fact, it is pretty straightforward! This lesson covers how to use much or many when
            they function as adjectives. Adjectives can only modify nouns. many – adjective: numerous, forming a large number of “Many” is used for things you can COUNT. People, cars, pencils, buildings, what ever it is; if you can COUNT it, you use “many”.
            1) Many people like to eat pizza. (Can you count people? Yes! So, use “many”!) 2) There are many books in our library on grammar. (Can you count books? Yes! So, use “many”!) 3) We can see so many birds at the pet shop! (Can you count birds?
            Yes! So, use “many”!) much – adjective: large in quantity, measure or degree “Much” is used for things you cannot COUNT. Sand, water, air, homework, information (uncountable nouns); anything where you can’t say: There are many sands. OR I
            see two waters. OR I have ten homeworks. That all sounds ridiculous, doesn’t it? You can say: I see two GLASSES OF water. OR I have ten PAGES OF homework. BUT you cannot use “many” or any number; you need to use “much”. 1) Ms. Maple gives
            too much homework! 2) There is so much water on the floor! 3) I drank too much coffee. *** Most nouns are countable, and some are not. List of uncountable nouns (list is not exhaustive!): air, water, sand, homework, information, privacy, nutrition,
            love, hate, milk, juice (any liquid), music, art, love, happiness, advice, news, furniture, luggage, rice, sugar, butter, electricity, gas, power, money, currency… just to name a few! Practice Exercises: a) My Math teacher always gives us
            so _________ homework! b) There are _________ people who like chocolate. c) I can see that you used ________ different colours in your painting. d) She doesn’t have ________ privacy because she shares her room with her sister. e) I don’t think
            it will cost ________ money! f) They have so ________ books on the floor that they can barely walk through the apartment! g)
