Transitive vs. Intransitive Verbs (Emily Rowan)

Before we delve into the main focus of this article, we will need to refresh our memories and recall direct objects. A direct object is a noun phrase which identifies a person or thing that receives the action of a transitive verb.
       Example:
I broke the window.
Broke is the verb of the sentence.
I broke what? The window.
Window is the direct object of the sentence.
Now that we can identify the direct object of a sentence, we’ll begin applying that knowledge to decipher the difference between transitive and intransitive verbs, as well as recognizing them in our lessons.
Transitive verbs are words that depend on an a direct object to receive the action of the verb.
       Example:
My sister borrowed the car.
What is it that my sister borrowed? The car.
Borrowed would be the transitive verb of the sentence,while the phrase the car would be the direct object.
 
Unlike transitive verbs, intransitive verbs do not require a direct object nor do they have a noun to receive the action of the verb.
      Examples:
The bird flew.
My sister blushed.
My mother laughed.
My father told jokes.
Verbs can be either transitive or intransitive depending upon the context of the sentence at hand.
Examples:
Transitive:
He ate the rest of the pie.
Monica drove the car to the theater.
Intransitive:
He ate.
Monica drove.
